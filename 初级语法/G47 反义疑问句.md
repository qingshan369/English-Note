1. 当陈述部分的主句是I suppose, I think, I believe等结构时，反意问句部分一般与that分句中的主谓保持对立关系. 如果陈述部分为非第一人称主语+think/suppose/believe/fancy/imagine/expect+that从句，同问句部分的动词和主语与陈述部分的主语动词和主语保持一致。
	- 如：I suppose that he is just joking, isn't he?
	- 如：I don't think you have got over the serious illness after a rest, have you?
	- 如：They all think that it's better to be busy than to be free, don't they?

2. 当陈述部分为I am...结构时，附加疑问句一般用aren't
	- 如：I am late, aren't I?

3. 当不定式短语，动名词短语，或者其他短语作陈述句部分的主语时，附加疑问句的主语通常用it。
	- Doing morning exercises has helped to improve her health, hasn't it?

4. 主语如that，this时，附加疑问句用it代替。
	- That's your sister, isn't it?

5. 当陈述部分的动词have/has/had表示“有”时，附加疑问句即可用have/has/had，也可用do/does/did；如果不表示“有”，则必须用do/does/did.
	- 如：He has a good memory, hasn't/doesn't he?
	- 如：You had breakfast, did you?

6. 句子中陈述部分的主语nobody为否定词，因此疑问句部分应用肯定形式；且当陈述部分的主语是somebody, someone, everyone, everybody, nobody等不定代词时，其疑问句部分的主语用they.
	- 如：Nobody heard him sing, did they?
